Australia is home to three-quarters of the world’s coral
population. With rising ocean temperatures, the Great Barrier
Reef is experiencing its third coral bleaching event in five
years. PROTECC Coral aims to improve the heat tolerance of reef
coral, while increasing the heat capacity of coral’s algal
symbiont: Symbiodinium. Our poster outlines how a synthetic
biological solution can help preserve our coral, as well as the
diverse ecosystems and communities that depend on them.
