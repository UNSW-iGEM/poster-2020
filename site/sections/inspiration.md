## Why We Care About Coral Bleaching
<br>
Australia’s global identity is hallmarked by the Great Barrier Reef, a biologically diverse ecosystem located off the coast of Queensland, Australia. Its coral reef is the largest in the world, containing over 600 coral species, and accounting for three-quarters of the world’s coral population. (1)
<br><br>
The UNSW iGEM team is made up of young people who call Australia home, and for whom the GBR is a national treasure. The reef is steeped in a history and culture that runs deep in our communities, with approximately 70 Traditional Owner groups’ sacred connections spanning back tens of thousands of years. (2) For many of us, the reef has taught us about the deep connection between human and land, and the vast complexities found within ecosystems. It has been a muse for art and stories; provided thousands of Australians identity and livelihood; acted as a holiday destination for many Australian and non-Australian families; and imparted inspiration for thousands of school-science projects. It has left its mark on our parents, our grandparents and our great-grandparents, and has ingrained in us a passion to carry this legacy on to future generations.
<br><br>
With all its history in our foundations, we face our dying GBR with one primal instinct: to want to protect our home. We believe ignoring it would be a great disservice to the generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who spent thousands of years protecting it before us. So, when given an opportunity to focus on one problem this year, we could think no further than the one happening in our own backyard.<br><br>

## Our Inspiration
<br>
As we face the problem of coral bleaching, we draw on inspiration from many people around us.
<br><br>
Firstly, we are inspired by the immense strength the Australian people have shown in the face of lost loved-ones, homes and livelihoods; a result of the effects of climate change.
<br><br>
Secondly, we are inspired by those who are contributing to a worldwide effort to conserve natural environments with advanced biotechnology. One of our sponsors, Revive & Restore (R&R), has implemented a ‘genetic rescue toolkit’, which features a crossover of genetic rescue, a standard conservation strategy, with advanced biotechnologies, such as genetic engineering and gene editing tools. (3) Seeing R&R navigate this crossover so gracefully has pushed us to imagine the possibilities of our own project, and explore the idea of this crossover in the context of coral bleaching.
Thirdly, we are deeply inspired by those who have been contributing to the global effort to save coral reefs for decades. Coral bleaching has been detrimental to countless marine ecosystems worldwide, and the severity of the coral bleaching problem cannot be understated. The UNSW iGEM 2020 Team is simultaneously proud and humbled to be contributing to a larger, global effort towards a long-term, practicable solution for coral bleaching. We are passionate about working towards our common goal: to preserve and restore coral reefs so future generations can enjoy them in their magnificent entirety.<br><br>
