        <h3>Poster Template</h3>
        <p>
          This poster template will let you create an interactive poster! The
          poster is divided in two parts: the visual overview on the left and
          the documentation on the right. The visual overview is broken down
          into sections that the user can click on. When a user clicks on a
          poster section in the visual overview, the documentation on the right
          will display the text and graphics associated with this section of the
          poster. You can find the documentation on how to use this template, as
          well as an example here:
