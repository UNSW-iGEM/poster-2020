Our experimental work aimed at characterising the chaperone activity of novel small heat shock proteins; HSP22E and HSP22F. This was done by assembly of the gene construct in the pET-19b plasmid and transforming the plasmids in E. coli chassis. E. coli was our chosen chassis due to their high growth rate and transformation efficiency. This was beneficial for producing large amounts of protein for characterisation, especially given lab access limitations due to COVID-19. Induction of HSP22E and 22F expression was followed by His-tag protein purification and assessing the activity of the chaperones in preventing protein aggregation. It was found the presence of the HSPs greatly reduced aggregation when compared to samples without the chaperones. This suggests HSP22E and 22F could be effective in preventing irreversible heat damage within Symbiodinium.

**Figure 1:** HSP22E (●) and HSP22F (Δ) are shown to decrease heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase (CS). Aggregation of CS was quantified by changes in absorbance at 500 nm over time.

Additionally, we conducted further characterisation by investigating their intermolecular interactions, involved in forming higher-order complexes. It became apparent that heat shock proteins 22E and 22F formed dimers with themselves through disulfide bonds. This was deduced as proteins were visualised through SDS-PAGE at both 37 kDa, 70 kDa and 140 kDa in denaturing conditions, however in the presence of a reducing agent (DTT), disulfide bonds ceased to form and HSP were mostly present in their monomeric form at 37 kDa. Further visualisation in their native state indicated formation of larger order complexes at 720 kDa and higher.
