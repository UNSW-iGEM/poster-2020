Science communication not only enables collaboration between scientists where research rationales, results and conclusions can be shared, it also bridges the gap in knowledge of a plethora of stakeholders who may not have a science background. Regardless of the ongoing pandemic, our team acknowledged the importance of communicating science to the society. Therefore, we made an attempt to share as much information about synthetic biology and our project to a wide range of audiences from primary school students to the general public.

Based on research, suggestions, and support from the previous UNSW iGEM team members, UNSW Puzzle Society, and UNSW BABSOC (School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Student Society), our team created the science communication components. We aimed to gather constructive feedback and spark open discussions about synthetic biology and coral bleaching among target audiences through various modes of communication including written texts, videos, games, and presentations. (1) Thus we created the different components of science communication: children’s book, an education package, a virtual escape room, a recorded interview video with MolecularCloud, and a presentation for the general public. From these, the team hopes that we have and will continue to increase awareness and inspire our community to contribute to the prevention of coral bleaching. Therefore, we also have some potential future collaborations that we have planned with other partners including with the University of Melbourne iGEM team, Student Science Squad, Startup Business International, The Future Project at Kings School, and the Kings School.


## Children's Book
The children’s book was targeted for children of the ages from six to nine. This book aimed to introduce children to 1) The main causes of global warming and 2) The effect it has on coral bleaching. It is both a story book and an activity book which empowers students to suppress global warming and hence coral bleaching.

## Education Package
The education package was designed to suit year 11 and 12 students in New South Wales (NSW). It consisted of several components including an instruction page for educators, lecture slides, a supporting document, a physical card game, project brochure, and a feedback form.

## Virtual Escape Room
Coral Conundrum is an online escape room which was aimed to expose university students to synthetic biology and our project. It also encouraged attendees to have open discussions about the topics with their teammates as they followed the storyline.

## MolecularCloud Interview
An interview session about our project overview was conducted between MolecularCloud and the UNSW 2020 iGEM team. The aim of this interview was to communicate our project about saving corals to the general public.

## Presenting to the Public
“How is Science Solving Local and Global Challenges?” was the theme of our presentation and panel discussion about taking on challenges. This was based on our iGEM project and the application of synthetic biology.
