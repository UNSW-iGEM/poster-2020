## Abstract:

Home to three-quarters of the world’s coral population, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is experiencing its third bleaching event in five years. With increasing ocean temperatures, coral reefs and the ecosystems that depend on them are at risk of serious, irreversible damage. Coral bleaching is a result of heat-induced oxidative stress, which triggers the ejection of corals’ microalgal-symbiont Symbiodinium spp. PROTECC Coral aims to improve the heat tolerance of coral by introducing small heat shock proteins alongside a glutathione recycling enzyme system into Symbiodinium spp., in order to reduce cellular stress. By engaging in conversations with various stakeholders (tourism industries, local councils, bioprospecting practices, commercial and recreational fishing and the GBR’s traditional owners) and integrating their advice, our team hopes to contribute to a worldwide conservation effort that enables future generations, both Australian and non-Australian alike, to enjoy the GBR in its entirety.
